# Test Cases Samples

Below are some Test Case samples that I wrote while working on previous projects.

**Description:**
Check if the login works when a person uses a wrong user/pass.

**Steps to reproduce**
1. Go to www.website.com/login
2. Add a wrong user/pass
3. Press Login button

**Expected Result:**
User should not be able to login. There will be an error message ”User or Password is wrong”

**Test Data:**
User: info & Pass: info1
